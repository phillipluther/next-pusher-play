# Next+Pusher POC

A little RTC experiment using Next.js and Pusher. Main motivation was connecting Next's page and API routes with the Pusher socket/channel offering.

Unimpressive demo at [https://next-pusher-play.vercel.app/](https://next-pusher-play.vercel.app/).

## Weird ...

There's an odd double-click issue on the demo site. Enter a message, click Send, nothing happens, click Send again, and voila! Works fine.

Given more time, care, and fux I'd fix that. The prototypal nature of this repo will likely prevent me from ever coming back here.

Archived.
